The New "Provider" Workflow
This is the magic. Now, to add a new provider (your laptop, your friend's PC, a lab computer), all you have to do is make sure that machine has Docker and the NVIDIA drivers, and then run one single command:

Bash

docker run --rm --gpus all \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -e ORCHESTRATOR_URL="httpsS://matcha-orchestrator.onrender.com" \
  -e API_KEY="your-secret-provider-key" \
  -e PROVIDER_ID="ruya-rtx-5070-laptop" \
  ruya/matcha-provider:latest
Let's break that down:

--gpus all: Gives the agent access to the GPU.

-v /var/run/docker.sock...: Gives the agent permission to run Docker tasks (the "Docker-in-Docker" trick).

-e ORCHESTRATOR_URL=...: Tells the agent the public URL of your deployed brain.

-e API_KEY=...: The secret key you set in your Render dashboard.

-e PROVIDER_ID=...: A unique name for this new provider.

ruya/matcha-provider:latest: The public image you just uploaded.

And that's it! Your provider agent will start, connect to the public orchestrator, register its "RTX 5070", and wait for jobs.
